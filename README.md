Bitbusy is a LED bar based on ESP32 microcontroller and WS2812 LEDs that indicates your work status, so your collegues won't distract you. 20$ alternative to the Busy Bar, that i've made for my mother's birthday
### Functionality
This device works like a timer: You choose time between 0-60 minutes and hit the main button to start your session. The device turns red, shows your status and time left.
